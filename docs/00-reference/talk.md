# VSCode Talk

- Introduction
  - "Moving towards a Frictionless Development Experience with VSCode, Docker and Codespaces"
  - Name, role @entelect etc.
  - No social media's.
- Disclaimer
  - This talk is not unbiased - I have picked scenarios where benefits are tangible, and I like VSCode and containers.
  - I am focusing in on the tooling and dev experience - not various other areas of friction within client and systems.
- But Why?
  - What is Friction?:
    - Quite hard to define, so I asked ChatGPT what Development Friction is, and it had a pretty good summary.
    - Development Friction?
      - Development friction refers to the obstacles or barriers that can slow down or impede the progress of a development project or initiative. Development friction can arise from a variety of factors, including bureaucratic red tape, political opposition, lack of resources or funding, technical difficulties, or cultural differences.
    - So that we don't end up here all day, I am going to focus in on the local development experience and reducing technical difficulties.
    - Local Development Causes:
      - Sometimes the stack is complicated
        - We work across complex application stacks, starting up every service and dependency can be torturous (microservices can be hard to deal with when developing).
        - **Example** - Microservices are a great way to decouple modules of an application and scale them as needed
      - Sometimes we have multiple stacks
        - Sometimes we need to jump between domains and stacks, with different technologies and dependencies. Keeping track of these and making sure they can all start is difficult.
        - **Example** - Current team is working on various shared services and tools across the client, meaning that if there are issues between them we need to be able to easily start up and debug an application.
      - Sometimes new people join the team
        - Grads and new team members now suddenly have to learn a new client, domain and tech stack. When everything is thrown in at once, having to figure out how to install RabbitMQ on your Dev machine can suddenly seem an insurmountable task.
        - **Example** Joining a new team is quite intense to start off with, between new people, new client and new domain - spending a week installing weblogic, rabbitmq, some or many database instances is painful.
- What do we want
  - One click deployment
  - Configure our environment in such a way that someone can come in from anywhere, click a single button and have a fully functional dev environment
- But how?
  - 5 easy steps
    - Our "example system" in this case is made up of a next SSR application, talking to a relational PostgresDB. This integrates to a C# "Worker" application for some heavy lifting that integrates via RabbitMQ.
    - Step 1 - Start with the ugly
      - I.e. start with a project
      - We need a starting point, need something to work with
      - **Swap to VSCode** with live demo of the system showed earlier
      - Talk through manual setup readme and how complex it is to then individually run additional services
    - Step 2 - Dockerise
      - As mentioned earlier - docker (or other Unix Container system) is vital to the improvements we need to make
      - Containers allow us to isolate and automate the complex dependencies of our system, such as RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL
      - **Swap to VSCode** and show how easy it is to start the applications - show updated readme.
    - Step 3 - Introduce a Workspace
      - VSCode finally makes an appearance
      - **Swap to VSCode** Show the debugger configuration and starting an application
    - Step 4 - Containers + Workspace = Dev Container
      - **Swap to VSCode** Show the 1-click opening of the project from Github in VSCode
    - Step 5 - Codespaces
      - **Swap to Github** open development environment in Github on cloud infrastructure
- Questions + Resources.
  - Repo and slides are available on Github.
